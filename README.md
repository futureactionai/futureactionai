## 🧠 Who We Are

**FutureAction AI** is an open-source initiative focused on building smart, accessible tools through **no-code/low-code development**.  
We use **AugeLab Studio**, a visual programming environment, to design AI-powered workflows — from computer vision pipelines to interactive logic systems.

Our approach removes technical barriers and invites everyone to innovate with AI — whether you're a coder or not.

## 🚀 What We Do

- 🧩 Build modular, plugin-based systems  
- 🧠 Focus on vision-AI and sensor-based interaction  
- 🔁 Combine rapid prototyping with scalable deployment  
- 🌍 Enable contribution from all skill levels via visual tools

## 🌱 Open Source & No-Code Contribution

We believe in inclusive innovation.  
That’s why our tools are not just open-source — they’re **visually programmable**.

💡 Using **AugeLab Studio**, you can build real AI workflows by connecting blocks, without writing code.  
🛠️ Developers can still contribute backend plugins in Python, and expand the ecosystem.

### ✨ You can contribute by:
- Designing new visual scenarios  
- Suggesting new plugin ideas  
- Improving docs and tutorials  
- Building new Python-based plugin blocks  
- Sharing how you use our tools!

No matter your background — if you're curious about AI, you're welcome here.
